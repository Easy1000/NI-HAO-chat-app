In this final project, our primary objective is to implement the concept of socket programming in a real-world application. This project is influenced by a prevalent and widely known chat application, Whatsapp. Thus, We attempt to build a web-based chat application named “NĬ HĂO” by connecting multiple clients to a server. There will be sockets both on the server and the client's side. Our purpose is to allow users to conveniently communicate with their peers by sending and receiving messages through the local host server. 

Thus, to achieve our final goal, we decided to write the program using the subsequent (Libraries & Frameworks):

- React ( Front-End Javascript)
- Socket.io (Client & Server)
- CSS (Styling)
- Express (Back-end)
